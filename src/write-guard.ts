/**
 * Per-instance write-authority state for one session-persistence backend.
 *
 * Each `PersistenceCoordinator` instance keeps its own UPSTREAM seq cursor in
 * memory, while this backend persists events under a DENSE seq. Two backend
 * instances (another `dsh` process, or a duplicate persistence plugin in the
 * same process) sharing one database therefore cannot both append to the same
 * session id: the second writer would silently re-number its batch onto the
 * first writer's tail and corrupt the log (event content and seq semantics all
 * misaligned — `UNIQUE(f_session_id, f_sequence)` cannot catch it because
 * dense re-numbering never collides). This guard records, per session, the
 * last CONFIRMED dense head this instance has seen — its own writes or
 * `loadStored` observations — and rejects any append whose on-disk head no
 * longer matches. One writer per session per log; a second writer fails loud
 * instead of corrupting the log. Different session ids are independent (each
 * has its own head), so two instances writing different sessions remain a
 * supported multi-process deployment.
 *
 * The guard also tracks the upstream seqs of delta events (`assistant/chunk`)
 * this instance has dropped per session. A later `assistant/message` may carry
 * `sourceEventSeqs` referencing those chunks' upstream seqs; the references
 * can never be remapped on read (the referenced events have no persisted row),
 * so the write path prunes them. The concurrent-writer guarantee above limits
 * each session to one writer, making this instance the only authority for its
 * dropped seqs.
 *
 * Pure in-memory state machine — no I/O — so the coordinator's timing contract
 * (never-read vs. confirmed absence vs. confirmed head; confirm after append /
 * after load / re-confirm after repair) is directly unit-testable instead of
 * requiring end-to-end multi-instance setups.
 * @module @morlay/session-persistence-rdb/write-guard
