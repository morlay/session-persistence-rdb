/**
 * Schema + event classification for the RDB session-persistence backend.
 *
 * The table layout follows the playpen-session store (three-table split):
 * `t_sessions` holds the header plus the head cursor, `t_events` holds each
 * event as a GLOBALLY addressable entity (event id + parent chain +
 * kind/role/name/action-id dimensions), and `t_session_events` bridges
 * sessions to events in per-session seq order.
 *
 * Naming is uniform: every table carries the `t_` prefix and every column the
 * `f_` prefix. The entities are declared ONCE in `src/entities/` (dialect-free
 * table descriptions); this module derives the SQLite drizzle tables from
 * them (STRICT + version/identity pragmas live with the SQLite backend in
 * `sqlite.ts`). There is no migration toolchain and no hand-written DDL.
 *
 * Delta content is NOT persisted: `assistant/chunk` events are dropped at
 * write time, and surviving events are re-numbered to a dense persisted seq
 * (`f_original_seq` keeps the upstream seq, so `sourceEventSeqs` provenance
 * can be remapped on read — see `log.ts`). This gives the backend the same
 * "ephemeral chunks stay out of the canonical log" semantics the persistence
 * proposal records, without requiring the upstream session layer to skip seqs.
 *
